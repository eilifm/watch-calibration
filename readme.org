* Watch Calibration

  small program that analyzes a recording of a watch or clock and
  tells you how slow or fast it runs

* examples

  with a good-quality recording, you'll see something like this:

  [[test-results/plots/strong-signal.png]]

  the top panel shows the last 10 seconds on the recording.  here, you
  can clearly see the individual ticks (this watch ticks 6 times per
  second).  and the noise

  the bottom left plot shows the fourier transform of the recording,
  zoomed in to the range of 0.5-10 Hz.

  and the bottom right plot shows a fit to the spectral peak, used to
  estimate the peak frequency to high precision.

  with a low quality recording, you'll see something more like this

  [[test-results/plots/weak-signal.png]]

  here, the individual ticks are buried in the noise.  but the program
  still picks them out!  you lose some precision, however

* accuracy
